Add your answers to the questions below.

What is the runtime complexity of your depth_first_for_each method?
linear -   `O(n)`
the more nodes you have 
the longer it will take to run
What is the space complexity of your depth_first_for_each function?

What is the runtime complexity of your breadth_first_for_each method?

linear as well for the 
same reason that depth 
first is linear

`O(n)`
What is the space complexity of your breadth_first_for_each method?

What is the runtime complexity of your heapsort function?

What is the space complexity of the heapsort function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?

I think it's O(n) but I'm not sure on anything at this point.
