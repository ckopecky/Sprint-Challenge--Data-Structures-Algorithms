Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your depth_first_for_each method?
- linear -   `O(n)`
    the more nodes you have 
    the longer it will take to run. touching every single element
    
2. What is the space complexity of your depth_first_for_each function?
    
    recursion - `O(n)` 
    iteratively - `O(n)` b/c in worst case we might have a tree that's just left branches.



3. What is the runtime complexity of your breadth_first_for_each method?

- linear as well for the 
same reason that depth 
first is linear. touching every single element. 

    `O(n)`

4. What is the space complexity of your breadth_first_for_each method?

    same as depth first
    `O(n)`
5. What is the runtime complexity of your heapsort function?
* high complexity just not sure how to compute that. 
At least `O log(n)`


6. What is the space complexity of the heapsort function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?

* I think it's O(n) but I'm not sure on anything at this point.
