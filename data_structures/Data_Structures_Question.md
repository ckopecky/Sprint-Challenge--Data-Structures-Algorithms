Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
```
linear -   `O(n)`
the more nodes you have 
the longer it will take to run
```
2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

```
linear as well for the 
same reason that depth 
first is linear

`O(n)`
```
4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
